    <h4><u>BREAK TAG:-</u></h4>
    <p>Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide
        on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are
        trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea.<br> In other
        words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and
        the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas,
        will grow.<br> The whole process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where
        there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.</p>
    <h4><u>HORIZONTAL RULE</u></h4>
    <p>Braille was blinded at the age of three in one eye as a result of an accident with a stitching awl in his
        father's harness making shop. Consequently, an infection set in and spread to both eyes, resulting in total
        blindness.[1] At that time, there were not many resources in place for the blind, but he nevertheless excelled
        in his education and received a scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student
        there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and
        efficiently. Inspired by a system invented by Charles Barbier, Braille's new method was more compact and lent
        itself to a range of uses, including music. He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824, when
        he was fifteen years old.</p>
    <hr>In adulthood, Braille served as a professor at the Institute and had an avocation as a musician, but he largely
    spent the remainder of his life refining and extending his system. It went unused by most educators for many years
    after his death, but posterity has recognized braille as a revolutionary invention, and it has been adapted for use
    in languages worldwide.</hr>
